It is not copycats as XKCD have provided their API FREE of charge for the purpose of allowing
people like myself to create an app based on their comic API. The XKCD API
is very limited in what information is sent. The api is specific to comic information only, that's all i have to work with. 

I Added the following mobile specific functionality...

1) Sharing a comic via email, social media etc
2) Saving a favorite comic
3) Retrieving a favorite comic
4) pinch zoom in/out
5) double tap zoom in/out
6) Swipe slide menu

It's a comic app, there isn't a whole lot one can do with a comic. Maybe altering or distorting the comic content which is something i won't do. 

Honestly Apple will allow something is simple and silly as a farting piano app onto the app store with hardly any features or mobile specific functionality but you wont allow my app?
